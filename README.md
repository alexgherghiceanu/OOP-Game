# OOP-Game

I developed this rouge-like game as the assignment for my OOP class. It served as an important step in becoming familiar both with the principles behind Object Oriented Programming, as well as different design patterns, such as the visitor, builder or factory patterns. Furthermore, it was an opportunity to get further aquainted with the development process of Graphic User Interfaces, using the swing toolset to create it.

Feature of the game:

- Intuitive GUI.
- Ability to log into different stored accounts.
- Ability to choose between characters of 3 classes (mage, rouge and warrior), each with their unique stats and abilities.

The main purpose of the game consists in traversing a map of random size, trying your best to avoid the hidden enemies and reach the portal, advancing you to the next level of the dungeon. The difficulty of the game comes in the uncertainty of reaching a new map and not knowing where anything is located, as the whole map is hidden at the begining. Furthermore, the combat encounters provide an extra challenge, as the randomly-generated enemies are equipped with powers similar to the player's.

Overall, this proved to be a really fun projected, that helped me further advance my skills as a programmer and dive deeper into the world of front-end development.
